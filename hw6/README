__Running the Game__ 

To run 'Too Many Dragons', pull the game code and images from the too_many_dragons folder. Run the code within. A pygame window should appear in which terrifying dragons fly accross the sky, occationally shooting fiery balls of terror in the direction of the heroine (visualized in third person in the center-ish of the screen for your playing pleasure). Using your magic shield, you must fend off the ever-increasing hoard of beasties until there are... TOO MANY DRAGONS.
